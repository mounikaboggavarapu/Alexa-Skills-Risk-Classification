Ring,ring,151000.0,unable to link the skill at this time,2.7,"""ring is the smart security solution that lets you watch over your home from anywhere. use the ring skill to manage all your ring devices. simply enable the ring skill in the alexa app and link your alexa and ring accounts to get started.

with a ring camera or doorbell, you can hear and speak to people in front of your camera from your firetvs, echo show, echo spot, echo speakers (such as echo, echo plus and echo dot). simply say:
“alexa, answer the front door.”
“alexa, talk to the backyard.”

to view activity from your ring camera, say:
“alexa, show the front door.”

to stop your ring feed, say:
“alexa, hide the front door.”
“alexa, go home.”
“alexa, stop.”

to see your most recent video clip from your ring camera, say:
“alexa, show me the last activity from the front door.”
“alexa, show the most recent event from the backyard.”
“alexa, pause.”

when ring doorbell is pressed, live view automatically streams on echo show along with the announcement. toggle to enable doorbell announcement is auto enabled. selecting specific alexa devices for doorbell, motion & person notifications is available. multiple alexa devices can now talk to one ring doorbell/camera at the same time.

if you share your ring devices with other users in the ring app, they can use alexa to see who’s at your home, too. note that viewing the most recent video clip is limited to ring protect plan subscribers, is not fully supported on ring video doorbell version 1 and stick up cam version 1, and is not available to shared users.


with ring smart lighting, you can control your lights and manage most of their settings directly with alexa. ring skill is compatible with all ring smart lighting, 3p works with ring light switches and non ring landscape lighting connected to the ring smart lighting transformer. ring smart lighting also works with alexa routines. look for your ring lights under the devices section of routines in the alexa app. note that a ring bridge is required for alexa integrations.

to turn on/off say:
'alexa, turn on my backyard lights'
'alexa, turn off my den light'

to manage settings for ring smart lights, say:
'alexa, set my patio lamp to 50%'
'alexa, turn on motion sensor on patio light'
'alexa, set motion sensitivity of patio lamp to low'

to manage settings for ring groups, say:
'alexa, disable ring motion alerts on backyard'
'alexa, set turn on time to 5 minutes on backyard'
'alexa, set shut off time to 1 minute on backyard'
'alexa, set alert snooze duration to 1 hour on backyard'

with ring alarm, you can: arm/disarm, create routines with contact and motion sensors, and lock and unlock 3rd party locks by providers such as kwikset, schlage, yale and more.

“alexa, arm ring.” (defaults to home mode)
“alexa, arm ring away.”
“alexa, disarm ring.”
“alexa, is ring armed?”
“alexa, lock my front door.”
“alexa, unlock my front door.”
“alexa, is the front door locked?""

alexa can notify you when your ring smart lights or ring alarm contact sensors/motion detectors are running low on batteries. you can also set up automatic reorders from [amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) so you’ll never run out of batteries.

the “bypass by voice” feature allows neighbors to bypass ring alarm motion detectors and contact sensors on doors and windows using alexa, without having to open the ring app.

the ring skill connects your ring video doorbell, ring video doorbell 2, ring video doorbell 3, ring video doorbell 3 plus, video doorbell pro, video doorbell elite, ring peephole cam, ring indoor cam, floodlight cam, spotlight cam, stick up cam wired/battery/plug-in/elite, ring smart lighting and bulbs, ring alarm, and locks connected to ring alarm to your echo show, echo show 5, echo show 8, echo spot, echo speakers, fire tablets and fire tv. the skill is compatible with all generations of fire tv, the second-generation fire tv stick, all fire tv edition smart tvs and fire tablets gen 7 and above.

a. ecobee website visitors
every computer connected to the internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. someispname.net) and an ip address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). when you visit a page on the ecobee website, we automatically gather and log the following information, some of which may constitute personal information:
•	your ip address;
•	the ip address of the website that may have referred you or that you may have linked to us from, if any;
•	the product identifier for version and make of your browser (e.g. internet explorer®);
•	the operating system platform that you may be running (e.g. macintosh® or windows®);
•	search words or terms that are passed from a search engine (e.g. google® or yahoo!®); and
•	information readily available and stored in your adobe® flash ‘system.capabilities’ object.
we collect this information for two main purposes. first, ecobee has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for visitors with various browsers and operating systems that visit the ecobee website. second, by analyzing visitor traffic and visitation patterns, referring urls and search engine terms, we can strategically enhance internet presence.
to allow the ecobee website to work properly and provide you with a personalized experience, we sometimes place cookies on your device.
you can choose whether to accept or reject cookies by changing the settings of your browser. typically, by accessing the browser’s help feature, you can obtain information on how to prevent your browser from accepting all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. if you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience on the ecobee website and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.
b. ecobee web store
if you purchase something, such as an ecobee product or accessory direct from ecobee, we require the customary information to allow us to complete the purchase. depending upon the method of payment and your location, the required information may include:
•	name;
•	billing address (for credit card orders);
•	shipping address;
•	email address;
•	phone number; and
•	credit card information (for credit card orders).
this information will be processed by our online shopping cart provider and our third-party payment processor. we use shopping cart features that seek to safeguard this information.
if you purchase your ecobee product as part of, or choose to participate in, an electricity usage or demand response program relating to grid stabilization or demand management, or an energy market program or environmental credit program (collectively, “utility programs”), your name, address, contact information, and other information relating to your purchase may be forwarded to your utility provider (“utility”), regional transmission organization, independent system operator, state agency, regulator, or third-party partners or implementors (with your utility, individually or collectively, “program administrators”). program administrators may use your personal information for their own purposes, including in order to verify your eligibility in the utility program, installation details, and for any potential rebates or other participation rewards.
if you select an installation option as part of your purchase (available in certain areas only), your name, address, and contact information may be forwarded to ecobee’s installation partner to facilitate the installation of your purchased product(s).
c. ecobee product users
in order to register your ecobee product on the ecobee website or ecobee app and create an ecobee account (“ecobee account”), you will provide an email address to associate with your ecobee account, and when you install your ecobee product, you’ll be asked for personal information like your name, home address, zip code, utility name, utility account number, and utility rate structure (if provided), as well as home characteristics (age, number of floors, type of heating, etc.) (together with your email address, “ecobee account data”). once your ecobee account is active, you can remotely view and control your ecobee product from the ecobee website or ecobee app.
your ecobee product collects environmental data, such as temperature and humidity, as well as operational data, such as thermostat runtime data and temperature set points from your hvac equipment. some ecobee product models may collect additional types of data, such as motion sensing (i.e., “occupancy sensing”). depending on your ecobee product model, your ecobee product may also collect data from remote sensors in addition to the ecobee product itself. our ecobee products, through machine learning with both on-device and remote processing, environmental sensors, operational hvac information and usage data, and occupancy sensing data, seek to minimize energy usage when you are home or away. collectively, this is known as “ecobee product data.” for ecobee smart security users, occupancy sensing data can be used to arm or disarm your home monitoring solution. to enable these remote functions, your ecobee product transmits encrypted ecobee product data to the ecobee website. the ecobee product data is stored on the ecobee website to provide you with historical reports.
we use both ecobee product data and ecobee account data to enable you to make more intelligent decisions about how to manage your heating and cooling, and to reduce your energy bills. we may also aggregate your ecobee product data with ecobee product data from other homes in order to create reports and benchmarks and to allow you (and others) to compare energy usage, on a deidentified basis, with similar homes. ecobee may also send you information and reports regarding your ecobee product’s operations, software updates, energy-savings opportunities, or promotions directly on the ecobee website, through the ecobee app,or via email.
you can delete your ecobee account and associated ecobee account data, as well as ecobee product data, by deregistering your ecobee product(s) using the ecobee website or directly through the ecobee product.
d. ecobee app users

e. mailing list and social communities
if you register for one of our mailing lists or online communities, we may use your email address to send you updates such as announcements, news, and information regarding new products or services. you have the option of unsubscribing at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email from ecobee or by contacting us as provided in the how to contact us section below.

f. eco+ and utility programs
eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your utility, and any utility programs. when you activate eco+, you will automatically be enrolled in demand response programs and events initiated by program administrators relating to grid stabilization or demand management (“default community energy savings programs”). you may be eligible to participate in additional demand response programs offered by program administrators, which may require you to accept additional terms and conditions and may offer you incentives to enroll and participate in the program (“additional community energy savings programs,” and together with default community energy savings programs, “community energy savings programs”).
in order to operate and make eco+ available, including the community energy savings programs, ecobee collects certain information from you and discloses this information to program administrators who may use this information for their own purposes. ecobee account data and ecobee product data collected and disclosed by ecobee to your program administrators may include ecobee account data, ecobee product data, and your thermostat serial number, while personal information collected and disclosed by program administrators to ecobee may include your name, your address, your utility account number, utility account information, your utility meter id, and utility meter data. subject to any applicable law, your personal information may be used to assess your eligibility to participate in utility programs; verify your participation in utility programs; assist in decision making relating to energy production, grid stability, and conservation; and provide demand response, energy measurement, and verification services to program administrators or the applicable governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the data disclosed to it by program administrators to improve the ecobee services.
the program administrators may also use your ecobee account data, ecobee product data, and electricity use in order to make intelligent decisions relating to electricity production and conservation, and to provide evaluation measurement and verification (“em&v”) reports and services. data contained in these em&v reports and services may be disclosed to the appropriate utility system implementors and regulators as part of the utility program. ecobee may also use this data to improve its services, including the utility program. the program administrators may also deidentify and aggregate your data with data from other homes and use that data for their own purposes.

  we at brunt are committed to protecting your privacy. our goal is to provide you with a positive experience on our websites and when using our apps, products and services, while at the same time keeping your personal information, as defined below, secure. our privacy practices are described below, as well as in separate notices given when an app, product or service is purchased or downloaded (our ""privacy policy""). this privacy policy covers all brunt products (including app) and brunt websites. by visiting brunt websites, using brunt products or providing us with your personal information (as defined below), you are accepting and consenting to the practices, terms and conditions described in this privacy policy.

  brunt wants to make brunt websites easy for you to navigate and brunt products easy for you to use. we are constantly improving brunt websites and brunt products to make them more user-friendly.

  for ease of reference, we will use the following terms in this privacy policy: ""brunt"", ""our"", ""us"" or ""we"" means brunt. co. ltd., including its global subsidiaries and affiliated companies. ""brunt websites"" include all global brunt websites. ""brunt products"" includes all brunt branded apps, products and services.



types of information covered by this privacy policy
  brunt may collect both personal information and non-personal information. ""personal information"" means any information that can be used to identify you. some examples of personal information include your name, address, email address and phone number. ""non-personal information"" means information that on its own cannot be used to identify you. some examples of non-personal information include usage data relating to brunt websites and brunt products, language preferences and brunt website page views.

  information may be aggregated and/or anonymized. when information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other customers and users. when information is anonymized, personal information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion of the data, containing only non-personal information, is repurposed for internal or external use, such as, for example, to determine how many users of a particular router include an internet-enabled television in a home network environment, or how many users viewed a particular website video or advertisement. aggregated information that includes personal information is considered personal information until it has been anonymized. anonymized information is considered non-personal information. in general, usage data collected when you visit brunt websites or use brunt products is both aggregated and anonymized so it does not identify you personally and is therefore non-personal information.

  the brunt websites and brunt products are not directed to, nor does brunt knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. if we are informed that we have collected the personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that personal information from our systems. if you believe we might have inadvertently collected personal information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at privacy@brunt.co.

within brunt for purposes of data processing or storage.
within brunt's corporate group, including with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy.
with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors to provide a requested service or transaction, including processing orders, hosting websites, storing your information, providing email communications on our behalf and providing customer support. we only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete or provide the requested service or transaction, and we do not allow third parties to use your personal information for a different purpose than what was disclosed to you.
with service providers, advisors or other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets. if brunt merges with or acquires or is acquired by another entity, personal information would be transferred as a whole to the successor entity.
to comply with the law or legal process (such as responding to subpoenas or court orders), to comply with government reporting obligations and to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
to protect our legal rights or those of others, such as protecting the brunt brand or investigating violations of brunt terms of use, violations of law, intellectual property infringement, misuse of brunt websites, fraud or potential threats to personal safety.
  in addition, we may share aggregated and anonymized non-personal information, including usage data about brunt products, with third parties for a variety of purposes, including to analyze trends about home networking and utility use, to show third parties how their products could work with brunt products and to generally improve home networking. we've taken steps to ensure that this information cannot be linked back to you and we require third parties to keep all shared information in its anonymized form.

  for certain brunt smart wi-fi products, brunt may provide the opportunity for you to connect and interface brunt products with one or more third party products and services, which will involve the exchange of information from your brunt product with the third party product or service. your explicit consent and authorization will be required at the time of connection to the third party product or service, and will be revocable by you at any time. in some cases, if you purchase, use or download a third party product or service that connects to a brunt product, you may also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. brunt is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party partners. if you access a brunt product through a third party product in this manner, you consent and agree to the privacy policy of such third party. we encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and terms of use of any third party products that connect to brunt products.

  any third parties with whom we share your personal information are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. we will take all reasonable steps to make sure these third parties comply with the same privacy principles that govern our collection of your personal information.

  when making purchases on the brunt website stores, brunt uses a payment processor to verify your payment card information. your payment card information is passed through to the payment processor and is not collected or stored by brunt. the payment processor is authorized to use this information only to authenticate your purchase and for no other purpose.



marketing
  you have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. we will inform you (before collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your personal information for marketing purposes, or if we intend to disclose your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes.

  we will always give you choices about your personal information. some choices are presented up front in the form of opt-in notices or acceptance boxes for marketing to you or sharing your personal information with third parties. in certain cases where permitted by law, we also may give you the choice to opt-out. ""opt-out"" means you have already chosen to opt-in, but you later change your mind. one form of opt-out is clicking the unsubscribe link in a marketing email. this will take you off of our marketing email list. brunt's general policy is to have users opt-in, rather than opt-out, to receive marketing information and to allow the sharing of information with third parties. please note that these opt-in/opt-out choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory website, service or software communications, such as update or downtime information, or receipt of order or shipping confirmations on brunt website stores, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel your service or order or terminate use of software in accordance with the applicable terms of use or license agreement.

  if you do not wish to receive direct marketing material from us or a third party, in addition to following the ""unsubscribe"" instructions in a marketing email, you can send us an email request at privacy@brunt.co.



new brunt products
  when you purchase and/or download new brunt products, we will only use your personal information for the purposes set out (i) in this privacy policy and (ii) in any notification provided to you at the time of purchase or download.



where we store your information
  the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, various locations globally, including the united states. it may also be processed by brunt staff or contractors operating outside your country of residence (including, if you are in europe, outside of the eea, or, if you are in australia or new zealand (anz), outside of anz) who work for us or for one of our suppliers. such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. we also use cloud-based applications and services to store and process your personal information, which may result in your personal information being stored outside your country of residence (or the eea or anz).

  we will take such steps as are reasonable to make sure we and our service providers do not breach the privacy principles that govern our collection of your personal information. by providing your personal information to us, you fully understand and consent to the transfer, processing and storage of personal information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different, and you consent to disclosure and use of your personal information to overseas service providers who may not fully comply with the particular laws of your country. our privacy policy and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. this means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, brunt will still handle your information in the manner described in this privacy policy and in conformity with all applicable laws.



accessing and updating your personal information
  we need your help in keeping your personal information accurate and up to date, so please notify us of any changes to your personal information. you can access and update your personal information and communication preferences at any time in the following ways:
by clicking the ""unsubscribe"" link in any email you receive from us.
by sending an email to privacy@brunt.co. please be sure to include your name, email address and specific relevant information about the information you would like to change or the material that you no longer wish to receive.

  we will honor your reasonable request to:
correct your data if it is inaccurate.
transfer your personal information to a third party.

provide you with a copy of personal information held on our current records at no charge, or for a reasonable charge if records must be accessed from backed up or archived records.

  we note again that, if you choose to no longer receive marketing information from us, we may still communicate with you about other matters, such as product and service updates for brunt products you have purchased and customer support matters.



retention of personal information
  we will only retain your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this privacy policy or otherwise as permitted by law.



cookies, web beacons and other web tools
  we use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links and widgets (collectively, ""web tools""). these web tools collect certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to brunt websites and brunt products, such as computer ip address, browser type and service provider. in addition, brunt uses small pieces of code called web beacons. web beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. this allows brunt to collect information such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referring page you previously visited, what browser or mobile device you are using, and your display settings. brunt and its advertising partners use web beacons, for example, to find out if advertising on brunt websites and other websites that contain brunt ads is effective, or if certain videos on brunt websites are being viewed.

  brunt may use web tools for the following purposes:
to identify the user's country and language and distinguish you from other users of brunt websites.
to save your registration information for future use on brunt websites and services.
to allow customer surveys to appear or not appear to customers.
to optimize your browsing experience by preloading certain features of brunt websites and services on future visits to make loading times faster and more efficient.
to understand how you use and interact with brunt websites and services.
to customize and provide you with a more personal experience when visiting brunt websites or our advertising partners' websites or when using brunt products.
to improve brunt websites and services.
to count visitors to brunt websites and brunt products and analyze website traffic, such as how many visitors have come to the brunt websites from advertisements on advertising partner websites.
  you have the following choices regarding brunt's use of web tools:
you may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or mobile device. however, many features of brunt websites and brunt products may not work as intended if you disable cookies, and areas that require registration or authentication and brunt website store transactions will not be accessible.
for some brunt products, you can go into the account settings and select an option that will remove you from personalized advertising. if you select this option, you will receive generic advertising as part of these brunt products rather than advertising that has been tailored based on your preferences.
many advertising companies are members of the digital advertising alliance or the network advertising initiative and provide opt-out choices on their websites.
  we do not currently respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate. if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this privacy policy. visit the following website, www.allaboutdnt.org, for more information on this developing area.

  in addition to brunt's use of web beacons on brunt websites, we allow certain third parties who provide brunt advertising on their websites to use their own web beacons within brunt websites. in that case, if you click on or view a brunt ad on one of our advertising partners' websites and are redirected or go to the brunt website, the advertising partner places a web beacon on your browser so that we can track advertising conversions (which let us know if an ad was effective). these web beacons will appear on your browser regardless of whether you have refused to accept cookies or indicated that you do not want to be tracked on brunt websites or on the internet generally. however, they are only used by brunt for the limited purpose of tracking advertising conversions and do not identify you personally in any way.

  third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use brunt websites. to avoid tracking by these third parties, you can exercise the choices above to reject cookies, although brunt has no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the do not track browser choices you have made.



security
  we strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by brunt websites and brunt products. unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not 100% secure. although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security; any transmission is at your own risk.

  it is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted personal information. if you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.

  we recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the internet. for example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. you should also be aware that names that you give your wi-fi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as ""friendly names"") may be detectable by others outside your home, so you should not use personal information as part of your friendly names.



updates and upgrades
  brunt products may be updated or upgraded from time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and generally make your user experience better. some brunt products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make updates automatically. you can change auto-update options by changing your settings within the brunt product account information. in very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied, regardless of the auto-update setting. for example, we may provide an automatic update that prevents or fixes a security vulnerability or breach to your network.



third party and social media linked sites
  brunt websites and online services may contain links to websites or online services operated by third parties. brunt products may also use or offer products and services from third parties, such as a third party app that works with a brunt product. once you leave brunt websites and brunt products, your activities are governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of the third party websites and online services. brunt is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites and online services, and we encourage you to carefully read the terms of use and privacy policies of any website and online service you visit.

  brunt websites and brunt products may contain social media features, such as facebook ""like"" buttons. these features may collect information about your device's ip address, set cookies to facilitate interaction with social media features or link you to a social media website where you may post personal information. all interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing the feature.



forums/chat rooms
  if you participate in or post information to a discussion forum or chat room on any brunt website or brunt product, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected, forwarded or used by other users of these forums, potentially inside or outside brunt, who have access to that forum. this information could also be used to send you unsolicited messages. please recognize that individual forums may have additional rules and conditions. each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of brunt. we are not responsible for personal information or any other information you may choose to submit in these forums, or the consequences of any submission. if at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at privacy@brunt.co. keep in mind that removal of a posting from a forum or chat room does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems, or that it has been completely removed from the internet.



updates to this privacy policy
  we may update this privacy policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. if we change our privacy policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. if we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by email or prominently post a notice on this website.



how to contact us

considering nice's responsibility, as the processor, to register contact data of the data protection officer working for the administrator (so, the user), the user, if there is an appointed dpo, is obligated to inform about this fact and pass contact data of that officer to the dpo indicated in the tos.
at the date of termination of the entrustment agreement, nice, according to the user's disposition, shall destroy or return, in a manner agreed on with the user, all personal data constituting the subject of processing and their copies (so, the data indicated in paragraph the scope of personal data processing), unless an appropriate provision of the country's or eu law dictate storing these personal data.
control of personal data processing
the user is obligated to provide full, up-to-date and true data.
every user, whose personal data are processed by the administrator, has the right to access their data and the right to rectify, remove, limit their processing, the right to transfer the data, the right to appeal against the processing of the data based on justified interest of the administrator. using the authorizations determined in the paragraph above may be carried out first by changing the settings of the user's account, and then, by sending an e-mail to the address: iod.pl@niceforyou.com with an appropriate request with providing the name and surname and electronic mail address of the user.
the user has the right to issue a complaint to a supervisory body if they think that the processing of their personal data infringes on the gdpr provisions.
sharing of personal data
user data may be shared with subjects authorized to receive them based on the law regulations, including the appropriate judicial authorities. personal data may be transferred to subjects processing them on an order, i.e. partners providing services connected with hosting, administration, maintenance and management of the website and services, as well as pursuing claims or investigating the circumstances of unauthorized using of the services or website.
nice provides services in the whole world and cooperates with partners internationally, so the data of our clients can be obtained by partners from world's regions where regulations on collecting and using data shall differ from the european law. nice emphasizes that transferring personal data to another country occurs only if the user lives in this country. one must remember that if the user plans on using the services in a country outside the european economic area, their personal data shall be transferred to a distributor in this country (i.e. countries outside the european economic area, including the united states). apart from that, while providing the services, nice uses the help from sub-contractors for hosting services, administering the desk.com website and potentially others, with whom the relation is going to be established along with the development or modifications of services.
the period of storing data and other information about processing
personal data are stored only for the period necessary to carry out a specific purpose for which they have been collected, so to fulfill the tos provisions and for needs of maintaining compliance with law regulations. the periods of processing data have been clearly determined with regard to the indication of the purposes of processing.
in the event of termination of the terms and conditions and the gateway terms and conditions, as a result of which the user's account is removed from the services, nice will delete the information stored there without the possibility of it further recovering, including all personal data concerning the user, unless separate regulations provide otherwise.
nice does not run operations consisting in automatic creation of personal profiles of its users.

""personal information"" means any information that can be used to identify you. some examples of personal information include your name, address, email address and phone number. ""non-personal information"" means information that on its own cannot be used to identify you. some examples of non-personal information include usage data relating to brunt websites and brunt products, language preferences and brunt website page views.

  information may be aggregated and/or anonymized. when information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other customers and users. when information is anonymized, personal information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion of the data, containing only non-personal information, is repurposed for internal or external use, such as, for example, to determine how many users of a particular router include an internet-enabled television in a home network environment, or how many users viewed a particular website video or advertisement. aggregated information that includes personal information is considered personal information until it has been anonymized. anonymized information is considered non-personal information. in general, usage data collected when you visit brunt websites or use brunt products is both aggregated and anonymized so it does not identify you personally and is therefore non-personal information.

  the brunt websites and brunt products are not directed to, nor does brunt knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. if we are informed that we have collected the personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that personal information from our systems. if you believe we might have inadvertently collected personal information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at privacy@brunt.co.

within brunt for purposes of data processing or storage.
within brunt's corporate group, including with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy.

  in addition, we may share aggregated and anonymized non-personal information, including usage data about brunt products, with third parties for a variety of purposes, including to analyze trends about home networking and utility use, to show third parties how their products could work with brunt products and to generally improve home networking. we've taken steps to ensure that this information cannot be linked back to you and we require third parties to keep all shared information in its anonymized form.

  for certain brunt smart wi-fi products, brunt may provide the opportunity for you to connect and interface brunt products with one or more third party products and services, which will involve the exchange of information from your brunt product with the third party product or service. your explicit consent and authorization will be required at the time of connection to the third party product or service, and will be revocable by you at any time. in some cases, if you purchase, use or download a third party product or service that connects to a brunt product, you may also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. brunt is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party partners. if you access a brunt product through a third party product in this manner, you consent and agree to the privacy policy of such third party. we encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and terms of use of any third party products that connect to brunt products.

  any third parties with whom we share your personal information are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. we will take all reasonable steps to make sure these third parties comply with the same privacy principles that govern our collection of your personal information.

  when making purchases on the brunt website stores, brunt uses a payment processor to verify your payment card information. your payment card information is passed through to the payment processor and is not collected or stored by brunt. the payment processor is authorized to use this information only to authenticate your purchase and for no other purpose.



marketing
  you have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. we will inform you (before collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your personal information for marketing purposes, or if we intend to disclose your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes.

  we will always give you choices about your personal information. some choices are presented up front in the form of opt-in notices or acceptance boxes for marketing to you or sharing your personal information with third parties. in certain cases where permitted by law, we also may give you the choice to opt-out. ""opt-out"" means you have already chosen to opt-in, but you later change your mind. one form of opt-out is clicking the unsubscribe link in a marketing email. this will take you off of our marketing email list. brunt's general policy is to have users opt-in, rather than opt-out, to receive marketing information and to allow the sharing of information with third parties. please note that these opt-in/opt-out choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory website, service or software communications, such as update or downtime information, or receipt of order or shipping confirmations on brunt website stores, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel your service or order or terminate use of software in accordance with the applicable terms of use or license agreement.

  if you do not wish to receive direct marketing material from us or a third party, in addition to following the ""unsubscribe"" instructions in a marketing email, you can send us an email request at privacy@brunt.co.



new brunt products
  when you purchase and/or download new brunt products, we will only use your personal information for the purposes set out (i) in this privacy policy and (ii) in any notification provided to you at the time of purchase or download.



where we store your information
  the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, various locations globally, including the united states. it may also be processed by brunt staff or contractors operating outside your country of residence (including, if you are in europe, outside of the eea, or, if you are in australia or new zealand (anz), outside of anz) who work for us or for one of our suppliers. such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. we also use cloud-based applications and services to store and process your personal information, which may result in your personal information being stored outside your country of residence (or the eea or anz).

  we will take such steps as are reasonable to make sure we and our service providers do not breach the privacy principles that govern our collection of your personal information. by providing your personal information to us, you fully understand and consent to the transfer, processing and storage of personal information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different, and you consent to disclosure and use of your personal information to overseas service providers who may not fully comply with the particular laws of your country. our privacy policy and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. this means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, brunt will still handle your information in the manner described in this privacy policy and in conformity with all applicable laws.

retention of personal information
  we will only retain your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this privacy policy or otherwise as permitted by law.



cookies, web beacons and other web tools
  we use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links and widgets (collectively, ""web tools""). these web tools collect certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to brunt websites and brunt products, such as computer ip address, browser type and service provider. in addition, brunt uses small pieces of code called web beacons. web beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. this allows brunt to collect information such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referring page you previously visited, what browser or mobile device you are using, and your display settings. brunt and its advertising partners use web beacons, for example, to find out if advertising on brunt websites and other websites that contain brunt ads is effective, or if certain videos on brunt websites are being viewed.

  brunt may use web tools for the following purposes:
to identify the user's country and language and distinguish you from other users of brunt websites.
to save your registration information for future use on brunt websites and services.
to allow customer surveys to appear or not appear to customers.
to optimize your browsing experience by preloading certain features of brunt websites and services on future visits to make loading times faster and more efficient.
to understand how you use and interact with brunt websites and services.
to customize and provide you with a more personal experience when visiting brunt websites or our advertising partners' websites or when using brunt products.
to improve brunt websites and services.
to count visitors to brunt websites and brunt products and analyze website traffic, such as how many visitors have come to the brunt websites from advertisements on advertising partner websites.
  you have the following choices regarding brunt's use of web tools:
you may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or mobile device. however, many features of brunt websites and brunt products may not work as intended if you disable cookies, and areas that require registration or authentication and brunt website store transactions will not be accessible.
for some brunt products, you can go into the account settings and select an option that will remove you from personalized advertising. if you select this option, you will receive generic advertising as part of these brunt products rather than advertising that has been tailored based on your preferences.
many advertising companies are members of the digital advertising alliance or the network advertising initiative and provide opt-out choices on their websites.
  we do not currently respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate. if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this privacy policy. visit the following website, www.allaboutdnt.org, for more information on this developing area.

  in addition to brunt's use of web beacons on brunt websites, we allow certain third parties who provide brunt advertising on their websites to use their own web beacons within brunt websites. in that case, if you click on or view a brunt ad on one of our advertising partners' websites and are redirected or go to the brunt website, the advertising partner places a web beacon on your browser so that we can track advertising conversions (which let us know if an ad was effective). these web beacons will appear on your browser regardless of whether you have refused to accept cookies or indicated that you do not want to be tracked on brunt websites or on the internet generally. however, they are only used by brunt for the limited purpose of tracking advertising conversions and do not identify you personally in any way.

  third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use brunt websites. to avoid tracking by these third parties, you can exercise the choices above to reject cookies, although brunt has no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the do not track browser choices you have made.



security
  we strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by brunt websites and brunt products. unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not 100% secure. although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security; any transmission is at your own risk.

  it is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted personal information. if you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.

  we recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the internet. for example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. you should also be aware that names that you give your wi-fi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as ""friendly names"") may be detectable by others outside your home, so you should not use personal information as part of your friendly names.



updates and upgrades
  brunt products may be updated or upgraded from time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and generally make your user experience better. some brunt products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make updates automatically. you can change auto-update options by changing your settings within the brunt product account information. in very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied, regardless of the auto-update setting. for example, we may provide an automatic update that prevents or fixes a security vulnerability or breach to your network.



third party and social media linked sites
  brunt websites and online services may contain links to websites or online services operated by third parties. brunt products may also use or offer products and services from third parties, such as a third party app that works with a brunt product. once you leave brunt websites and brunt products, your activities are governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of the third party websites and online services. brunt is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites and online services, and we encourage you to carefully read the terms of use and privacy policies of any website and online service you visit.

  brunt websites and brunt products may contain social media features, such as facebook ""like"" buttons. these features may collect information about your device's ip address, set cookies to facilitate interaction with social media features or link you to a social media website where you may post personal information. all interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing the feature.



forums/chat rooms
  if you participate in or post information to a discussion forum or chat room on any brunt website or brunt product, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected, forwarded or used by other users of these forums, potentially inside or outside brunt, who have access to that forum. this information could also be used to send you unsolicited messages. please recognize that individual forums may have additional rules and conditions. each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of brunt. we are not responsible for personal information or any other information you may choose to submit in these forums, or the consequences of any submission. if at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at privacy@brunt.co. keep in mind that removal of a posting from a forum or chat room does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems, or that it has been completely removed from the internet.



updates to this privacy policy
  we may update this privacy policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. if we change our privacy policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. if we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by email or prominently post a notice on this website.

cookies and similar technologies
what is a cookie?
cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your hard disk or to your browser's memory when you visit one of our sites. cookies are useful because they help arrange the content and layout of our sites and allow us to recognize those computers or other devices that have been to our sites before. cookies do many different jobs, such as allowing our sites to remember your preference settings and helping us to enhance the usability and performance of our sites and your experience using them.

our sites also may contain electronic images known as web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow us to count the number of users who have visited specific pages. we may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

categories of cookies and similar technologies that we use
the type of cookie or similar technology that may be used on our sites can be put into 1 of 4 categories: strictly necessary, performance, functionality & profile and advertising.

strictly necessary cookies
these cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around our sites and use their features, particularly in connection with information searches and order placement. without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided. these cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet. an example of a strictly necessary cookie is a “shopping basket cookie,” which is used to remember the products that you wish to purchase when you add products to your shopping basket or proceed to checkout.

performance cookies
these cookies collect information about how you use our sites, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages. these cookies collect information that is used to improve how our sites work. without these cookies we cannot learn how our sites are performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience. examples of performance cookies that our sites use include google and adobe analytics (see further discussion below).

functionality & profile cookies
these cookies allow our sites to store information that you provide such as your site language preferences and to store technical information useful for your interactions with our sites. for instance, they remember your user id and elements of your user profile. they also ensure that your experience using the sites and our marketing efforts are relevant to you. they may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. these cookies will not be used to track your browsing activity on other websites.

without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you have previously made or personalize your browsing experience. for example, we use a cookie to store your language preferences, which allows us to present you with product search results in the correct language, and we use a cookie to store your choice about the appearance of the cookie information banner that we display on our sites. this cookie will help us remember your choice about the appearance of the cookie information banner when you subsequently visit the same site where you made your choice about the banner and any other company sites with the same domain or the same top-level domain.

advertising cookies and similar technologies
these cookies or similar technologies may be used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. they may also be used to limit the times you see an advertisement as well as help to measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. these cookies may track your visits to other websites. without these cookies or other technologies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.

we permit third-party advertising partners to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you use our sites, including products that you browse or purchase and your location. examples of advertising cookies or similar technologies that we use include google adwords and facebook pixels.

Modern Forms Smart Home,wac lighting,136.0,unable to link the skill at this time,3.3,"""modern forms fans are the future of smart home fans, designed to adapt to your routine, reduce energy costs, and make life simpler all year-round.

modern forms fans for amazon echo integration allows you to sync up your modern forms fan(s) with an amazon echo device to enable voice-activated commands and more.

to get started, select the ""enable"" button in your alexa app and log in. authorize the link to the modern forms account used with your modern forms app, and then alexa will discover devices. for more details, see connect a smart home device to alexa.

the modern forms smart home skill discovers and displays your modern forms rooms. each room with a fan is visually displayed as a fan. rooms containing fans with light kits are also visually displayed as a light.

for convenience, we recommend creating alexa groups that match the rooms in your modern forms app. simply add the discovered modern forms rooms to those alexa groups, and it's just like using the modern forms app for control, except you are using your voice. for details, see create a smart home device group.

you can also use alexa groups to control multiple modern forms smart fans. for example, add the modern forms smart fans and lights in your home theater, first floor bar, and recreation rooms to an alexa group named ""basement."" say, ""alexa, set basement lights to 60%,"" and alexa will dim the lights in those rooms.

tell alexa to turn on or control a modern forms smart fan or light that is in a room. for example, ""alexa, turn on kitchen light.""

configure an alexa group to match a room in the modern forms app and tell alexa to control that group. for example, ""alexa, turn on living room fan.""

you can use alexa to:

turn fans or lights on or off. for example, ""alexa, turn on bedroom fan.""

change fan speed. for example, ""alexa, increase dining room fan speed to 6"" or ""alexa, set dining room fan speed to 3.""

change light brightness. for example, ""alexa, set library lights to 85%"" or ""alexa, brighten library lights to 99%"".

change fan season modes. for example, “alexa, set bedroom fan to summer season” or “alexa, set bedroom fan to winter season” or “alexa, set bedroom fan season to summer” or “alexa, set bedroom fan season to winter”.

for bluetooth fans change breeze mode settings. for example, “alexa, set bedroom fan breeze on” or “alexa, set bedroom fan breeze low” or “alexa, set bedroom fan breeze high” or “alexa, set bedroom fan breeze medium” or “alexa, set bedroom fan breeze off”.

use the urc smart home skill to try any of these phrases:

alexa, turn on chandelier
alexa, dim kitchen pendants
alexa, set thermostat to 75 degrees
alexa, increase thermostat by 3 degrees
alexa, turn on movie scene

note to end users: urc total control and mx homepro are professionally-installed smart home automation and control systems. please consult a urc dealer for a complete list of compatible sub-systems and installation information, as well as other supported phrases. please visit www.universalremote.com to locate a total control or mx homepro dealer.

the urc mobile app may not always replicate the exact standard alexa device control behavior. for example, when controlling thermostats via alexa, set point limits may be statically set between 50°f and 90°f regardless of the original manufacturer set point limits.

scene creation with the urc smart home skill was designed with the utmost flexibility in mind. whether controlling light, shades, temperature and even today's most popular audio-video components, alexa fully blends into your urc scene control solution giving you the flexibility of true vocal command of your smart lifestyle. future skill iterations will allow for control of other devices not currently supported.

information about product we collect and use
media access control (mac) address

when you use our product, we may obtain non-public information but we’ve designed our product from the very beginning to protect data privacy with the principles that (i) we have no intention of capturing any personal information or real-world identity (ii) we analyze only aggregated data, and (iii) anyone can opt out of participation in this data collection.

when you use our product, we sense the following: the presence of the device, its installation-related information, and a unique identifier known as its media access control (mac) address. this combination of numbers and letters identifies a specific device to the surrounding networks. because the mac address does not disclose the device owner’s real-world identity nor any other personal data, that information is never collected.

we collect and aggregate only anonymous data from your device into reports for us. these reports are used to help us to find and remove errors from our software program, and improve our product services. at no point is your name, phone number, or any other personal information collected by us.

when we provide our product vendor with an analysis of errors, we never include device-specific data nor any personal information of you included in the analysis. only aggregated data is used.

we do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose device-specific information to third parties.

security and privacy

we employ reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your device information. we use industry-recognized technical safeguards, such as firewalls, and have adopted and implemented security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. when we collect your device information, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the secure socket layer (ssl) protocol. we will retain and use your device information for as long as your device is active.

Virtual Smart Home,cornelius suermann,13.0,unable to link the skill at this time,3.0,"""note: this skill requires an instance of node-red with the corresponding 'virtual-smart-home' package installed.

if you use node-red to automate stuff in your home, this skill is for you! it allows you to configure 'virtual device' nodes which can then be invoked through alexa.

for example, you can set up a virtual switch, which triggers an action when you say ""alexa, turn my virtual switch on"". when invoked, the node will emit a message object that you can route to any other node in your project, e.g. to actually do switch on a real device, or to post a tweet on twitter, or do whatever you want...

the skill supports the following pre-configured virtual device types:

- switch
- plug
- dimmable light bulb
- color changing light bulb
- dimmer switch
- blinds
- fan
- thermostat
- scene

to be able to use this skill you need an installation of node-red including the 'virtual-smart-home' package which can be found and installed through the 'palette manager'. afterwards you can select the 'virtual device' node from the palette and use it in your project.

more details can be found in the docs that are embedded in the help section of node-red.""","""privacy policy

security measures

we use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal data. intermatic provides various security strategies to effectively ensure data security of user and device. as for device access, intermatic and its technology partners employ proprietary algorithms to ensure data isolation, access authentication, and applying for authorization. as for data communication, communication using security algorithms and transmission encryption protocols and commercial level information encryption transmission based on dynamic keys are used. as for data processing, strict data filtering and validation and complete data audit are applied. as for data storage, all confidential information of users will be safely encrypted for storage. if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you should immediately notify us of the problem by emailing customersupport@intermatic.com.



data retention

we process your personal data for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the data for a longer retention period. we determine the appropriate retention period based on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your personal data, and after the retention period ends, we will delete your personal data.

for as long as you require us to fulfill the products and services you request from us as defined in the software terms & conditions.
personal data will no longer be retained when you request to remove your personal data, we will accordingly complete the task.  when we are unable to do so for technical reasons, we will ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent any further such use of your personal data.
 

children’s privacy

protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to us. the services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that these individuals do not provide any personal data to us. we do not knowingly collect personal data from any child unless we first obtain permission from that child’s parent or legal guardian. if we become aware that we have collected personal data from any child without permission from that child’s parent or legal guardian, we will take steps to remove that information.

some jurisdictions may prohibit a disclaimer of warranties and you may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

15. limitation of liability. in no event will the lockly entities be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages (including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, or any other intangible loss) arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your inability to access or use, the services or any materials or content on the services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other legal theory, and whether or not any lockly entity has been informed of the possibility of damage.

the aggregate liability of the lockly entities to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the use of or any inability to use any portion of the services or otherwise under these terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you have paid to lockly for access to and use of the services in the 12 months prior to the event(s) or circumstances giving rise to the claim; or (b) $100.

some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages. accordingly, the above limitation may not apply to you.

each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does allocate the risks between the parties under these terms. this allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these terms. the limitations in this section 15 will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

16. governing law. these terms are governed by the laws of new york without regard to conflict of law principles. however, the courts in some countries will not apply new york law to some types of disputes. if you reside in one of those countries, then where new york law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. if a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these terms, then you and lockly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within new york for the purpose of litigating any dispute.

17. general. these terms, together with any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and lockly regarding your use of the services. except as expressly permitted above, these terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these terms. you may not assign or transfer these terms or your rights under these terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. we may assign these terms at any time without notice or consent. the failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these terms, or any provision of these terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. use of section headers in these terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. if any part of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. upon termination of these terms, sections 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9 through 21, along with any other accompanying agreements, will survive.

18. dispute resolution and arbitration

generally. if you are a resident of the united states, then this dispute resolution and arbitration section applies to you. in the interest of resolving disputes between you and lockly in the most expedient cost-effective manner, you and lockly agree that every dispute arising in connection with these terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court and can be subject to very limited review by courts. arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. this agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these terms. you understand and agree that, by entering into these terms, you and lockly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
exceptions. despite the provisions of section 1, nothing in these terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
arbitrator. any arbitration between you and lockly will be referred to and resolved binding arbitration administered under the rules of the american arbitration association (aaa).
notice; process. a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified or registered mail or by internationally recognized overnight courier services (return receipt or signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“notice”). lockly’s address for notice is: 2024 macopin rd., unit e, west milford, nj 07480. the notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“demand”). the parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the notice is received, you or lockly may commence an arbitration proceeding. during the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or lockly must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award if any. if the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, lockly will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by lockly in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
fees. if you commence arbitration in accordance with these terms, lockly will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided under the rules of american arbitration association (aaa). any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in new york, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the aaa rules. in that case, you agree to reimburse lockly for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
no class actions. you and lockly agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. further, unless both you and lockly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
modifications of this arbitration provision. if lockly makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to lockly's address for notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to lockly's address for notice, in which case your access to or use of the services will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
enforceability. if section 6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this section 18 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this section 18 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to these terms.
19. consent to electronic communications. by using the services, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us , including but not limited to information related to new products, services, features and benefits. you agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.

your privacy is important to portalshark and mobile integrated solutions. so we’ve developed a privacy policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.


collection and use of personal information
personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.
you may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with portalshark or mobile integrated solutions. portalshark and mobile integrated solutions may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this privacy policy. we may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, and content.
here are some examples of the types of personal information portalshark and mobile integrated solutions may collect and how we may use it.
what personal information we collect
• when you create a mobilinc connect account or mobilinc x subscription through the mobilinc connect website or through the mobilinc apps, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences.
how we use your personal information
• the personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on our latest product announcements and software updates. it also helps us to improve our services and content. if you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out by contacting us directly.
• we also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and content.
• from time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about our mobilinc apps, mobilinc connect service and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. because this information is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
• we may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications.

collection and use of non-personal information
we also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. we may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. the following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
• we may collect information such as language, zip code, area code, and push unique device identifier, so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products and services.
• we also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and the mobilinc connect services including continuous energy readings from compatible connected isy devices. this information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this privacy policy.
if we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

cookies and other technologies
portalshark and mobile integrated solutions website, online services, interactive applications, and email messages may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. these technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website or applications people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our products and services. we treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. however, to the extent that internet protocol (ip) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this privacy policy.
portalshark, mobile integrated solutions, and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. our goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal. for example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the mobilinc connect website. cookies are also used on the mobilinc connect website to allow the service to provide an always on connection to our backend servers and your connected isy series controller.
if you want to disable cookies and you’re using the safari web browser, go to safari preferences and then to the security pane to disable cookies. on your apple mobile device, go to settings, then safari, and then to the cookies section. for other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. please note that the energy section of the mobilinc connect website will no longer function with cookies disabled.
as is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. this information includes internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type and language, internet service provider (isp), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
we use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. we may use this information in our marketing services.
in some of our email messages, we use a “click-through url” linked to content on the portalshark and mobile integrated solutions website. when customers click one of these urls, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. we track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. if you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. we may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

disclosure to third parties
at times portalshark and mobile integrated solutions may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with portalshark or mobile integrated solutions to provide products and services, or that help portalshark and mobile integrated solutions market to customers. personal information will only be shared by portalshark and mobile integrated solutions to provide or improve our products and services; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
service providers
portalshark and mobile integrated solutions shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. these companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever portalshark and mobile integrated solutions operate.
others
it may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for portalshark or mobile integrated solutions to disclose your personal information. we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
we may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

protection of personal information
portalshark and mobile integrated solutions takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
portalshark and mobile integrated solutions online services such as the mobilinc connect website and mobilinc connect service use secure sockets layer (ssl) encryption on all web pages and communication where personal information is collected. to use these services, you must use an ssl-enabled browser such as chrome, safari, firefox, or internet explorer. doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the internet.

integrity and retention of personal information
portalshark and mobile integrated solutions will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

access to personal information
we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if portalshark or mobile integrated solutions is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting us at support@mobilinc.com.

children
we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. if we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the age of 18 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

third-party sites and services

our companywide commitment to your privacy
to make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to portalshark and mobile integrated solutions employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.

smart home next also supports voice commands for switching the input source (hdmi 1, hdmi 2, hdmi 3) and control of the 4k hdr usb media player (play, pause, rew, ff, next, previous, start-over).

before enabling smart home next skill, please ensure that you have completed the optoma device registration using the optoma connect app -- available for ios and android. open the optoma connect app, create an account or login, select projector from the menu at the bottom and then select the plus (+) button. follow the instructions to link projector to your optoma connect account, enable the skill and link your optoma connect/mydevices account to alexa.

smart home skill voice commands
""alexa, turn on living room""

""alexa, turn up the volume by 10 on living room""
“alexa, turn down the volume by 10 on living room""
“alexa, set volume to 55 on living room”
""alexa, switch input to hdmi 1 on living room""
""alexa, switch input to hdmi 2 on living room""
""alexa, switch input to hdmi 3 on living room""

**4k uhd/1080p usb media player commands**

*the play command is the only command that can be used from the home screen or while using another input. using the play command while using hdmi 2 (for example) will result in a change of input – the media player will launch, and file playback will begin.
**next, previous, ff, rew, stop, pause and start over commands can only be used during playback of media content and or while the 4k uhd hdr media player is open.

""alexa, play on living room"" (playback will begin with first video or audio file on the usb disk/drive).
""alexa, pause on living room""
""alexa, stop on living room""
""alexa, next on living room""
""alexa, previous on living room""
""alexa, fast forward on living room""
""alexa, rewind on living room""
""alexa, start over on living room"" (restart playback from beginning of usb drive).

troubleshooting:
-- issue #1: unable to power-on projector using “alexa, turn on living room”.
possible solution 1: ensure that power mode standby is set to ""smart home"". from the launcher (home screen), go to “settings > power > power mode (standby)” – select “smart home”.

-- issue #2: alexa does not respond to commands.

possible solution 1: confirm the alias name. go to projector in the optoma connect app or go to https://mydevices.optoma.com.

possible solution 2: ensure all devices (echo and projector) are on the same network.

-- issue #3: unable to select specific files on usb drive using voice commands.

possible solution: alexa does not support “file names” therefore when the “play” command is used, playback will start with the very first file (video or audio) on the usb drive. to navigate, simply use the “previous” and “next” commands to play the previous file or next file on the drive.

we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy, which is available upon request by contacting us at gdpr@optoma.co.uk.

in some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘request erasure’ below for further information.

furthermore, in some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

9. your legal rights
under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. you have the right to:

request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

request erasure of your personal data. this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

request restriction of processing of your personal data. this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at gdpr@optoma.co.uk.

no fee usually required

you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

what we may need from you

we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). this is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

time limit to respond

we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

protecting your privacy and your personal data is important to us, which is why we programme and operate our online services with data protection in mind. in this data protection information, we explain to you the extent to which we collect your personal data, in particular what types of personal data we collect from you when you use our website, how we collect this data and process it, for what purposes and on what legal basis this is done, and what rights and claims result from this for you.

 

01 personal data
 
personal data is individual information about personal or factual circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person. information that cannot be directly or indirectly linked to your identity - such as the number of users of a site - is not personal data.

in the case of mybusch-jaeger, this includes data that you yourself have provided to us, such as registration data, contact data, or depending on the services used, other data may be added, such as bank data, as well as data of the devices that are assigned to the user account.

we will use the personal data that you have provided to us in the context of this online offer exclusively for this purpose. we will not pass on your personal data to third parties unless you give your express consent to do so or we are obliged to do so by law or by a court or official decision. an exception to this are order processors, who we carefully select and contractually bind to our instructions and oblige to strictly observe the necessary technical and organisational measures to comply with data protection.

 
02 legal bases for the processing
 

the processing of your personal data is necessary to achieve the aforementioned purposes. unless explicitly stated otherwise when collecting your personal data, the legal basis for data processing is:

the performance and fulfilment of a contract with you (art. 6 (1) (b) dsgvo),
the performance of legal obligations to which we are subject (art. 6 (1) (c) dsgvo), or
the protection of legitimate interests of us or of third parties after weighing up the interests (art. 6 (1) (f) dsgvo): our legitimate interest lies in the processing of your personal data for the purpose of offering and operating our internet pages and online services as well as your interest in our offers.
in exceptional cases, we expressly request your consent to the processing of your personal data. in this case, the legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the consent you have given (art. 6 (1) (a) of the gdpr), which you can revoke at any time in accordance with art. 7 (3) of the gdpr with effect for the future.

 
03 usage data on the mybusch-jaeger service platform
 

während jedes nutzungsvorgangs werden ereignisse registriert, wie z.b. welcher nutzer oder welches gerät wann und für welchen zeitraum auf das system zugegriffen hat oder welche dienste verwendet wurden. diese daten werden ihnen auch in form von einer historie zur verfügung gestellt. die vorhaltezeit für solche ereignisse beträgt drei monate. davon abgesehen verwenden wir solche daten ausschließlich anonymisiert zu statistischen zwecken.

 
04 protokollierung
 

soweit bei der erhebung ihrer personenbezogenen daten keine ausdrückliche speicherdauer angegeben wird, werden ihre personenbezogenen daten gelöscht, sobald diese nicht mehr zur erfüllung des zweckes der speicherung erforderlich sind und/oder die oben beschriebenen zwecke der datenverarbeitung entfallen. über die zweckerreichung hinaus kann eine speicherung dennoch erfolgen, soweit wir auf grund gesetzlicher vorschriften (z.b. handels- und steuerrechtliche aufbewahrungspflichten) dazu verpflichtet sind. in diesem fall wird die verarbeitung eingeschränkt und die daten werden nach wegfall oder erfüllung der jeweiligen gesetzlichen verpflichtung gelöscht.

vorhandene cookies können sie jederzeit löschen. wie das im einzelnen funktioniert, erfahren sie in der anleitung ihres browser- bzw. geräte-herstellers. 
sollten sie sich gegen den einsatz von cookies entscheiden, kann es sein, dass ihnen nicht alle funktionen unserer internetseiten oder einzelne funktionen nur eingeschränkt zur verfügung stehen.

hinweis zu google analytics.

beim einsatz dieses analyse-werkzeuges können daten an in den usa gelegene server der google inc. übertragen und dort verarbeitet. bitte beachten sie dazu folgendes: in den usa besteht aus der sicht der europäischen union kein den eu-standards entsprechendes „angemessenes schutzniveau“ für die verarbeitung personenbezogener daten. dieses schutzniveau kann jedoch für einzelne unternehmen durch eine zertifizierung nach dem sogenannten „eu-u.s. privacy shield“ ersetzt werden. 
im auftrag des betreibers dieser internetseite wird google diese informationen benutzen, um ihre nutzung der internetseite auszuwerten, um reports über die internetseitenaktivitäten zusammenzustellen und um weitere mit der internetseitennutzung und der internetnutzung verbundene dienstleistungen gegenüber dem internetseistenbetreiber zu erbringen. die im rahmen von google analytics von ihrem browser übermittelte ip-adresse wird nicht mit anderen daten von google zusammengeführt.

06 externe links
 

wenn sie unsere internetseiten besuchen, verarbeiten und speichern wir bestimmte angaben zu dem von ihnen verwendeten browser und betriebssystem, das datum und die uhrzeit des besuches, den zugriffsstatus (z.b. ob sie eine internetseite aufrufen konnten oder eine fehlermeldung erhielten), die nutzung von funktionen der internetseiten, die von ihnen möglicherweise eingegebenen suchbegriffe, die häufigkeit, mit der sie einzelne internetseiten aufrufen, die bezeichnung abgerufener dateien, die übertragenen datenmenge, die internetseite, von der aus sie auf unsere internetseiten gelangt sind, und die internetseite, die sie von unseren internetseiten aus besuchen, sei es, indem sie links auf unseren internetseiten anklicken oder eine domain direkt in das eingabefeld derselben registerkarte (bzw. desselben fensters) ihres browsers eingeben, worin sie unsere internetseiten geöffnet haben.

darüberhinausgehende personenbezogene daten verarbeiten und speichern wir nur, falls sie uns diese daten z.b. im rahmen einer registrierung eines benutzerkontos, eines kontaktformulars, oder sonstigen kontaktaufnahme von ihnen erhalten, wie z.b. vor- und zuname, e-mail-adresse, telefonnummer, informationen, die im rahmen einer anfrage angegeben werden, kommentare oder forenbeiträge. für bestimmte online-dienste können wir kreditkarten- oder andere zahlung informationen anfordern. in diesen fällen werden wir sie in der regel mit separaten vorrangigen datenschutzhinweisen darüber informieren, inwieweit wir für die vorgenannten  datenverarbeitungsprozesse ihre personenbezogenen daten erheben und verarbeiten, für welche zwecke und auf welchen rechtsgrundlagen dies geschieht, und welche rechte und ansprüche sich daraus für sie ergeben

wir verarbeiten ihre personenbezogenen daten somit für folgende zwecke:

um ihnen die inanspruchnahme der leistungen und funktionen der busch-jaeger-internetseiten und deren internet-angebote sowie online-plattformen zu ermöglichen,
um ihre identität festzustellen und eine nutzer-authentifizierung zu ermöglichen,
um ihre anfrage zu bearbeiten, z.b. hinsichtlich unserer produkte und/oder busch-jaeger-dienstleistungen und

um unsere nutzungsbedingungen erforderlichenfalls durchzusetzen, rechtsansprüche geltend zu machen oder abzuwehren und um betrügerische und ähnliche handlungen, einschließlich angriffe auf unsere it-infrastruktur, abzuwehren und zu unterbinden
07 benutzergenerierte inhalte/blogs
 

wir bieten auf unseren internetseiten auch dienste an, bei denen sie selbst informationen veröffentlichen können, die dann anderen besuchern der internetseite zur verfügung stehen (z.b. diskussionsforen und kommentare zu blogs). sollten sie diese dienste in anspruch nehmen, werden grundlegende informationen, die sie auch als „user“ identifizieren, zu-sammen mit ihren geposteten informationen anderen besuchern der betreffenden internet-seite zur verfügung gestellt. dies betrifft freiwillig von ihnen bereitgestellte informationen, z.b. ihren namen oder ein pseudonym (nickname) und ggf. weitere informationen über ih-ren wohnsitz sowie den namen des unternehmens oder der organisation, für die sie arbei-ten. sie entscheiden eigenverantwortlich, welche daten sie von sich preisgeben wollen und sie können in bezug auf ihre daten über ihr persönliches benutzerprofil steuern, was im ein-zelnen in ihren beiträgen öffentlich angezeigt wird.
wir selbst erhalten informationen über ihre jeweilige ip-adresse, die anzahl der von ihnen geposteten forenbeiträge und/oder eine bewertung, die zeigt, wie nützlich andere besucher ihre beiträge bewertet haben. weitere informationen finden sie auf den hilfeseiten der ein-zelnen dienste. 
soweit bei der erhebung ihrer personenbezogenen daten nicht ausdrücklich anders angege-ben, ist die rechtsgrundlage für die verarbeitung dieser personenbezogenen daten die wahrung unserer berechtigten interessen nach erfolgter interessenabwägung (art. 6 (1) (f) dsgvo). unser berechtigtes interesse liegt hierbei darin, ihnen die beteiligung an foren und/oder blogs zu ermöglichen und die jeweiligen interessen an foren und/oder blogs zur verbesserung unserer dienste und angebote auszuwerten.

08 übermittlung und weitergabe personenbezogener daten
 

busch-jaeger übermittelt ihre personenbezogenen daten gegebenenfalls an andere abb-gesellschaften, wenn dies im zusammenhang mit unseren internet-angeboten und dem betrieb der internetseiten und der angebote und/oder online-plattformen zur klärung ihrer anfrage und/oder der anbahnung, durchführung oder abwicklung einer geschäftsbeziehung mit abb-gesellschaften erforderlich ist. eine liste der abb-unternehmen finden sie hier auf der website von abb.

eine weitergabe erfolgt auch an dienstleister, die im rahmen ihrer leistungserbringung daten für uns verarbeiten (wie z.b. dienstleister für it wartungstätigkeiten), oder gerichte, schiedsgerichte, behörden oder rechtsberater, wenn dies zur einhaltung geltenden rechts, oder zu geltendmachung, ausübung oder verteidigung von rechtsansprüchen erforderlich ist.

sofern wir ihre personenbezogenen daten an abb-gesellschaften weitergeben, setzen wir die datenschutzrichtlinien und sicherheitsvorkehrungen des abb konzerns um, damit wir sicherstellen können, dass personenbezogene daten konzernweit einheitlich unter beachtung der einschlägigen datenschutzgesetze verarbeitet werden.

einige abb-gesellschaften haben ihren sitz in ländern, deren datenschutzgesetze unter umständen ein schutzniveau vermitteln, das nicht dem schutzniveau des landes entspricht, in dem sie ihren (wohn-) sitz haben. in diesem fall ergreifen wir maßnahmen, um geeignete und angemessene garantien zum schutz der personenbezogenen daten anderweitig sicherzustellen. an abb-gesellschaften in solchen ländern und andere externe dienstleister geben wir ihre personenbezogenen daten deshalb nur weiter, wenn diese (i) eu standardvertragsklauseln mit uns abgeschlossen oder (ii) binding corporate rules eingeführt haben oder (iii) - bei empfängern mit sitz in den usa - unter dem eu/us privacy shield zertifiziert sind.

im falle einer übertragung des eigentums an teilen von busch-jaeger, wie z.b. übernahme durch oder fusion mitanderen unternehmen, werden wir sie, sofern dies gesetzlich erforderlich ist, benachrichtigen und um ihre zustimmung bitten, bevor personenbezogene daten übertragen werden und somit einer anderen datenschutzrichtlinie unterliegen.

4. profiling and automated decision making
the advertisements and recommendations (including online, while you are logged into your razer id account, and while you are using our mobile app) which we show you are chosen by analysing the personal information you provide to us as described in section 2, including information about your past purchases from us, the way in which you use our products and/or services, and previous advertisements which you have clicked on. to choose advertisements which are tailored and most likely to be of interest to you, we compile and analyse information received from all our customers to gain a better understanding of your preferences from customers similar to you.

we use similar predictive techniques to combat payment fraud, as described below.

5. identity verification
when you create an account or initiate a transaction on our site, we may process your personal information (including your name, mobile number, identification number, passport number, nationality, address, date of birth and related documents including your identification card, passport, proof of residence documents such as utility, phone or bank statements and/or government agency letter) for the purposes of identity verification checks and/or to comply with our know-your-customer obligations under applicable laws. you may submit such personal information to us through a third party such as jumio (http://www.jumio.com) or singpass myinfo (http://api.singpass.gov.sg/). if the personal information submitted to us is insufficient, inaccurate and/or does not pass our identity verification checks in our view, we may disable your account and/or decline to process your transaction(s). in the event you selected biometric verification as an authentication option, then razer will collect and process a public key generated by your device for the purpose of (a) identity recognition; (b) login verification; and/or (c) transaction instruction verification. this public key is generated by your device using public key cryptography and sent to razer when you select biometric verification. upon receipt by razer, this public key will be associated with your razerid account, so that razerid can recognize and verify your device. in doing so, razer does not process or access any biometric information stored on your device, including your private key kept in your device. for avoidance of doubt, razer does not collect, transfer, process, control or possess any biometric information that you may have stored on your device (eg. fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, exercise, genetic, physiological, behavioral or biological data).

6. processing of payments on our site
when you submit a payment request on our site (including when making purchases from our online store, or when purchasing razer gold or razer silver), we pass your payment information (including information about your past transactions, the current transaction, your razer id, credit card details and ip address) to a third party service provider, namely forter (http://www.forter.com) which conducts anti-fraud checks on our behalf. our online store merely queries whether the payment information provided by you satisfies the criteria set by forter's algorithm and then returns back the results. if your payment information does not satisfy forter's criteria, the payment request will be declined.

this process may result in you not being able to complete a purchase on our site. you may want to check your payment information or try again using a different method of payment. otherwise, you may request that we provide information about our decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that the automated decision has been made correctly. we may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime but generally in these circumstances we will ask forter to verify that its algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias.

7. sharing your personal information (and transfers outside of the eea)
we will only use or disclose your personal information for the purpose(s) it was collected and as otherwise identified in this privacy policy.
sharing outside the razer group: personal information may be provided to third parties, including anti-fraud organisations, legal, regulatory or law enforcement authorities in cases of suspected criminal activity or contravention of law, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of governments, regulatory authorities or other self-regulatory organizations, or to comply with a court order or for the protection of our assets (for example, collection of overdue accounts).
sharing within the razer group: we may share your personal information within the razer group, including locations outside of the european economic area where we do business, for marketing purposes, for legal and regulatory purposes, to manage credit risk and other business risks, to perform analytics, to ensure we have correct or up to date information about you (such as your current address or date of birth) and to better manage your relationship with us.
business sale or reorganization: over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. accordingly, personal information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be reviewed as part of the due diligence process and subsequently transferred as a business asset to the new business owner. we may also transfer personal information as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.
sub-contractors and agents: we may use affiliates or other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account administration, fraud prevention and detection, analytics and marketing. such companies will be given only the personal information needed to perform those services and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. we have contracts in place holding these companies to the same standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.

8. eea rights to personal information / gdpr
eea individuals have the right, under certain circumstances, to:
access their personal information;
correct inaccurate personal information;
request erasure of their personal information without undue delay;
request the restricted processing of their personal information;
to receive the personal information that they have provided us with, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit that information to another controller without hindrance or ask us to do so; and
to object to the processing of their personal information.

such users may request access to their personal information and modify or remove most information associated with their razer account at any time by logging into their razer account and accessing features such as edit profile and account info. users may also email to exercise any of the above rights by emailing us at dpo@razer.com.

9. transfers outside of the eea
your personal information may be accessed by staff, suppliers or other persons in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the european economic area (eea) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the eea. we will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal information as set out in this privacy policy.

where we transfer personal information from inside the european economic area (the eea) to outside the eea, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant personal information. certain countries outside the eea have been approved by the european commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to eea data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. in countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as eu commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.

if you live outside the eea, or california, razer will undertake best efforts to give you a similar degree of control over your privacy.

10. security of your personal information
(a) we use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your personal information in our custody or control.

(b) we have agreements and controls in place with third party service providers requiring that any information we provide to them must be safeguarded and used only for the purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.

11. security over the internet
(a) no data transmission over the internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. however, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.

(b) all information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors' secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. we ask you not to share a password with anyone.

12. retention of your personal information
our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. we retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. for example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. when personal information is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data.

13. marketing
most of our processing is permitted by ""legal grounds"" other than consent (see section 2 above). in relation to direct marketing, where we are required to do so, we will obtain your consent before using your personal information for this purpose. if you prefer not to receive our direct marketing communications and/or not have your personal information shared among the members of the razer group for the purpose of marketing, you can have your name deleted from our direct marketing and/or shared information lists.

direct marketing means our communication with you such as mail, telemarketing or email, using your contact information, to inform you about products and services that we think may be of interest and value to you. this does not include communications regarding products or services that you currently have, including improved ways to use the products, or additional features of the products as well as transactional information.

14. updating information
we will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate. in order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out in the ""contacting us"" section below.

15. your rights
if you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, you should first contact us as per the ""contacting us"" section below. under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:

(a) provide you with further details on the use we make of your information;

(c) update any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold;

(d) delete any personal information the we no longer have a lawful ground to use;

(e) where processing is based on consent, to withdraw your consent so that we stop that particular processing;

(f) object to any processing based on the legitimate interests ground unless our reasons for undertaking that processing outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights;

(g) restrict how we use your information whilst a complaint is being investigated; and

(h) your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege). if you exercise any of these rights we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month.

Cuby Smart,arteko electronics,5.0,unable to link the skill at this time,4.0,"""control you air conditioner using the cuby smart skill for amazon alexa.

this skill requires:
1. a cuby smart device (www.cuby.mx)
2. the cuby smart app for ios or android
3. a cuby smart account with at least 1 configured cuby

steps:
1. enable the skill
2. link your cuby account to alexa by typing your cuby username and password
3. run ""discover devices"" in alexa or ask alexa to discover devices by saying: ""alexa, discover devices""

you will now be able to control your air conditioner by using your voice.

to have the best experience, name your cubies (inside the cuby app) using simple names that alexa can understand and pronounce easily. avoid having similar names among cubies. no special characters are allowed. if you ever change the name of the cuby, you will need to re-discover devices so that alexa gets the updated names.

important:
do not name your devices ""air"", ""air conditioner"" or ""aircon"" since that will make alexa send the wrong command.

some sample commands ( <device> is the name of the cuby or group):

""alexa, turn on <device> ""
will turn on the a/c.

""alexa, turn off <device> ""
will turn off the a/c.

""alexa, set <device> to <x> degrees""
will set the a/c to <x> degrees. alexa will respond with the current a/c mode too so that you know what setting is currently active.

""alexa, set <device> to <mode> mode""
will set the a/c to <mode> mode. possible modes are ""cool"", ""heat"", ""auto"".

""alexa, make <device> warmer ""
will increase the a/c temperature by 1 degree.

""alexa, make <device> cooler""
will decrease the a/c temperature by 1 degree.

""alexa, increase <device> by <x> degrees""
will increase the a/c temperature by <x> degrees.

""alexa, decrease <device> by x degrees""
will decrease the a/c temperature by x degrees.

""alexa, what is temperature of the <device> ""
alexa will tell you the temperature that the cuby read with it's internal temperature sensor.

""alexa, what is <device> set to?""
""alexa, is <device> on?""
alexa will report the last mode and temperature the a/c was set to using cuby (if you use the original remote control, it may report an incorrect state).

if you need support using this skill, please contact us at: www.cuby.mx (help@cuby.mx)

if you device is not showing or if it has a different name than then one shown in the cuby app, try discovering devices again.""","""this privacy policy applies to all users of our site www.cuby.io / www.cubylabs.com / www.cuby.mx (“our site”) and all products and services provided by us including related mobile applications (collectively “services”).

information we collect through automatic data collection technologies
like many websites and online services, we use “cookies” and other tracking technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags (collectively “automatic data collection tools”) to personalize your use of our website and to provide you with a better and faster user experience. we allow our service providers to utilize automatic data collection tools for analytic and marketing purposes. some of the automatic data collection tools we use are associated with your customer account and others are not. we may use “session cookies” (cookies that last until you close your browser) or “persistent cookies” (cookies that last until you or your browser delete them).

we also automatically collect usage information and other technical information about how you use and navigate our website, apps, or other online services, such as your ip address, the equipment you use to access online services (such as a browser or mobile device), time of your use, what features are used, how long you spend on our online services and other “clickstream” information.

if you are concerned about the use of automatic data collection tools, you may be able to direct your browser to reject cookies or to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent. you may also delete a cookie manually through your browser or other programs. if you are using a mobile or wireless device to access our website, your mobile or wireless carrier may use cookies or unique identifier headers to transmit certain information about you to third parties. contact your mobile or wireless carrier to change or opt-out of such setting if possible. note that some parts of our website may not function properly or may not be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.

online behavioral advertising is automated, customized advertising that you see when using online services, like ads in mobile apps or on websites. those ads are served to you based on inferences about your interests. those interests are determined from data collected about you, whether by us or other parties. in addition, some content, or applications, including advertisements, on the website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. these third parties may use cookies to collect information about you when you use our website. the information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services and they may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference-based advertising purposes (referred to as “do not track signals” or “dnt notice”). unfortunately, given the lack of standardization among browsers and interest-based advertising technology, dnt notices may not effectively accomplish this goal. for this and a variety of other reasons, with respect to our website, we do not take any particular action based on browser-based dnt notices.

The Smart Speakers Daily,thesmartspeakers.com,5.0,skill was enabled,5.0,"""these short updates keep you up-to-date about the developing voice landscape.

we feature news about, for example:
* the production and presentation of briefings

* the take-up of voice devices and case-studies of how they are being used (such as hospitality, education and business settings)
* reports into voice-orientated sales strategy

there *won't* be deep-dives into skills and how to code them! (who *is* jason anyway?!)
