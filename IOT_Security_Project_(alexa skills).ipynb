A \\u201cweb beacon\\u201d, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and may be used to transmit information collected through Cookies back to a web server.\\n\\n\\n2.- WHAT INFORMATION DO WE OBTAIN THROUGH COOKIES?\\n\\nThe information we may obtain through cookies includes your device IP address, identifiers associated with your devices, types of devices connected to our services, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and dates and times of visits to Sites.\\n\\n\\n3.- COOKIES USED ON OUR SITES\\n\\nBelow is a description of the cookies that we use on our Sites. You can see a list of the cookies and indicate your choices with respect to the use of cookies through the Cookie Preferences Manager and the Control Center (once you log into your account). Please note that, depending on your selection, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Sites or our products and services.\\n\\n\\n\\u25cf Web and App Analytics Cookies\\nWe use Analytics Cookies to understand how users navigate and use our Sites. For example, these cookies collect information on the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Sites in various ways, such as:\\n\\u2022 Refining our Sites based on how customers use them;\\n\\u2022 Optimizing the pages and features customers use the most;\\n\\u2022 Testing different versions of pages and features to find the best solutions for customers;\\n\\n\\n\\u25cf Advertising Cookies\\nWe use Advertising Cookies to serve certain types of advertisements, including for products and services not available on Ring.com and for certain ads relevant to your interests.\\n\\nAdvertising Cookies may collect information on whether a user has reacted to an advertisement or visited another website or application. Such cookies help us offer you content and provide targeted information that seems more relevant to your interests. They also help us measure the effectiveness of our advertisements and control and limit the frequency of advertisements and other information being displayed to you.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, we work with third parties to provide certain services to our users such as additional features including the ability to see videos, use the live chat functions on our Sites, and connect to certain social networks. These third parties use cookies to collect information on our Sites, including via plug-ins and widgets. We use third-party cookies to serve you relevant advertisements for products and services. We do not sell your personal information throughout this process.\\n\\n\\n\\u25cf Essential Cookies\\nEssential Cookies are necessary to navigate our Sites and use its functions and thus cannot be disabled. These cookies help us collect certain information, such as your session ID and other server information, which enables us to provide services such as authenticating users through security features like Two-Step Verification. Essential Cookies will remain on your browser until you remove them, which may impact your ability to navigate our Site and use its functions.\\n\\n\\n4.- YOUR CHOICES\\n\\nYou can manage your data preferences using two built-in tools. The Control Center manages your preferences when you\\u2019re logged into your Ring account, while the Cookie Preferences Manager controls your preferences when you\\u2019re browsing Ring.com websites when you are not logged in (e.g., e-commerce -- ring.com/products). We will apply your cookie preferences to our Sites and the browser on which you made your choice.\\n\\nDifferent cookies may be used between your logged in and/or logged out experiences. If you disable a particular cookie in the Cookie Preferences Manager, but have enabled it in the Control Center, we will disable it for both logged-in and logged-out experiences. But if you enable a particular cookie in the Cookie Preferences Manager and disable it in the Control Center, we will disable it throughout your logged-in experience but enable it in the logged-out experience because we are not able to verify the identity of your Ring account when you are logged out.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can disable cookies from your web browser by selecting the appropriate settings. Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, how to disable or remove existing cookies and when cookies will expire. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking \\u201chelp\\u201d on your browser\\u2019s menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device. Please note, however, that without certain cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Sites or our products or services. For example, if you disable all essential cookies in your browser, you may not be able to add items to your shopping basket, proceed to checkout or use any our Sites that require login. You may also need to manually adjust some of your preferences every time you visit one of our Sites.\\n\\n\\n5.- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nFor our European ring.com domains, there is a 13-month retention period for Analytics Cookies and Advertising Cookies on your browser, which starts once you opt-in to the cookies via the Cookie Preferences Manager. If you opt out of such cookies via the Cookie Preferences Manager, then we will remove them from your browser and disable them until you change your preferences.\\n\\n\\n6.- CONTACT US\\n\\nIf you have any questions about this Cookie Policy, please contact us by e-mail at: privacy@ring.com.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Skill_Policy_3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\\"EU/Swiss/UK-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\\nEU/Swiss/UK-U.S. Data Privacy Framework: Disclosures\\nLast Updated: March 15, 2024\\n\\nRing LLC and its subsidiaries Ring Protect Inc. and Wireless Environment, LLC (collectively, \\u201cRing\\u201d) participate in the EU-U.S., UK Extension to the EU-U.S., and Swiss-U.S.* Data Privacy Frameworks (collectively, the \\u201cData Privacy Framework\\u201d) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

organisational measures to safeguard your personal data:\\n\\nyour personal data is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.\\nall data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.\\nin the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.\\ndata exchanged between smartlife devices and servers are encrypted using secure sockets layer (\\u201cssl\\u201d).\\nthere is an optional two-step verification process when users access their smartlife account.\\nthere is regular review of information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.\\naccess is restricted to smartlife employees and third party service providers who need to know that the information in order to process it, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.\\nthere are also access controls for all server clusters used for cloud-based data storage and process.\\nmost data used for smartlife\\u2019s products and/or services is stored in a storage system. by using column family based access control mechanism, smartlife employees are only allowed access to the data column families they are granted access to.\\nplease note also that for the above, smartlife may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by smartlife to process or back up your personal data. currently, smartlife has data centres in beijing and singapore. as a result, we may transfer to and store your personal data at our overseas facilities. however, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.\\ninformation
